# Banff

Welcome to the Banff CLI! This is my first project as a Flatiron school student.

This application pulls information from Trip Advisor's Banff website "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g154911-Activities-Banff_Banff_National_Park_Alberta.html", which lists 30 different attractions that Banff, Alberta, Canada has to offer! It's a small town placed smack-dab in the middle of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. It is quietly known as one of the world's highest rated tourist towns! Find out which attractions you're interested in most and then make your dream trip a reality! 

## Installation

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
